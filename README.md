#A Refactoring Macro in VBA for Stocks

#Overview of Project: The purpose of this project was to create a product for my client, Steve, 
to share with his parents to support them in their investments decision-making using a clean and 
organized output of information. Essesntially, Steven and his parents are now able to use the 
simple click-of-a-button to sift through thousands of data points.

#Results: The refactoring code showed a great deal of difference in growth of stocks between 2017 and
2018. As you can see in the below images, 2017 had nearly all positive change in return, whereas in 2018
there was near unanymous loss in value. On both years' data, the stocks were refactored in an extremely
fast time, as evidenced by the stopwatch from the macro:

#Summary: 

###Advantages and Disadvantages: The clear advantage of refactoring code is that it makes it
more applicable on a larger scale. That is, if Steve has a different set of data he wants to sort, from
say, a different year, then the refactored Macro can easily be applied to those new data. The potential
disadvantage is that though it saves an immense amount of time by quickly sorting an entire dateset, the
larger the data set it is used on, the greater potential for errors in the output. ###Advantages and
Disadvantages in VBA: An advatage of refactoring through VBA is the great potential for discovering and
fixing bugs. A potential disadvantage is that VBA is a dated coding language that may not maintain
relevance over time.
