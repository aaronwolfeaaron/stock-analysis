#A Refactoring Macro in VBA for Stocks

##Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project was to create a product for my client, Steve, to share with his parents to support them in their investments decision-making using a clean and organized output of information. Essesntially, Steven and his parents are now able to use the simple click-of-a-button to sift through thousands of data points.

##Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The stocks were refactored in an extremely fast time, as evidenced by the stopwatch from the macro:

##Summary: 
###Advantages and Disadvantages: The clear advantage of refactoring code is that it makes it more applicable on a larger scale. That is, if Steve has a different set of data he wants to sort, from say, a different year, then the refactored Macro can easily be applied to those new data. The potential disadvantage is that though it saves an immense amount of time by quickly sorting an entire dateset, the larger the data set it is used on, the greater potential for errors in the output.
###Advantages and Disadvantages in VBA: An advatage of refactoring through VBA is the great potential for discovering and fixing bugs. A potential disadvantage is that VBA is a dated coding language that may not maintain relevance over time.
